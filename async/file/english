We wouldn't say that commenting on an Instagram post is a hassle, but it is slower than it could be. Wouldn't it be nice if you could simply share your thoughts while you're still in your main photo feed? You might have that option right now. Instagram has been testing a feature that lets you comment on a photo directly from your feed. All you have to do is look at a photo for a few seconds -- if you're included, an "add a comment" text box will pop up.
